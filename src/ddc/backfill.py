"""Historical backfill — index the whole history of ML applied to chemistry.

Walks OpenAlex (which aggregates Crossref, PubMed, arXiv and more, with
abstracts for classification) using cursor pagination:

* **Topic sweep**: a set of broad ML×chemistry search queries, one year at a
  time, oldest publications to newest.
* **Pioneer sweep**: the complete publication lists of the researchers named
  in ``config/pioneers.json`` (their papers still pass the same classifier).

Progress is checkpointed after every query: papers are flushed to the monthly
shards and the seen-set is saved, so an interrupted backfill can simply be
re-run and will skip everything already ingested.
