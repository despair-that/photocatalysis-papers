"""Keyword knowledge base for classification.

Three vocabularies drive the relevance decision:

* ``PRIMARY_TERMS`` — photocatalysis-specific vocabulary. A paper must show
  strong evidence here to be indexed at all: this is the project's core rule,
  *photocatalysis as the primary subject*.
* ``SUPPORT_TERMS`` — materials, reactions, characterization, computational
  and data-driven methods that refine the score and assign categories.
* ``NEGATIVE_TERMS`` — signals the paper belongs to a neighbouring field
  (photovoltaics, LEDs, photodynamic therapy...).  ``penalty`` points.

Weights: 4 = unambiguous ("photocatal…", "photoredox"), 3 = strong,
2 = supportive, 1 = weak/generic.  Tags become the visible chips on paper
cards; categories group papers for browsing.
